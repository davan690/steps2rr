## Initial steps toward reproducible research

A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations is
that they be _reproducible_: that the code and data are assembled in a
way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g., the
figures in a paper).

Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy.
This is a minimal tutorial to get started.
